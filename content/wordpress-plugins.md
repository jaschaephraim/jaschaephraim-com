Many jobs over the years have called for the development of custom themes and plugins for WordPress. In the couple of cases that plugins added simple and widely-applicable functionality, I released them in the WordPress plugin repository. 

# [Page Management Dropdown](http://wordpress.org/plugins/page-management-dropdown/)
Ideal for using WordPress as a CMS, Page Management Dropdown expands the Pages administration menu by adding a link to edit each of your individual pages.

# [Seamless Sticky Custom Post Types](http://wordpress.org/plugins/seamless-sticky-custom-post-types/)
There are no settings or custom functions. Set custom post types to be sticky just as you would with regular posts, and those post id's will be included in the result of `get_option( 'sticky_posts' )`.
