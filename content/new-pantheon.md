From 2006–2009, I directed and composed for an ensemble of varying instrumentation, first called the Jascha Ephraim Memorial Library and later New Pantheon.

The initial group consisted of guitar, drums, electric bass, trombone, clarinet, violin, and singers, and performed our first show at the Knockout in San Francisco.

The largest group was formed for the production of _A Living Olympus_, my unreleased 2008 film. It consisted of drums, sousaphone, trombone, trumpets, cello, viola, violins, singers, and—for one performance anyway—a concert harp.

The final ensemble was a traditional string quartet with myself and Jessy Brown singing.
