From Aprilâ€“November 2017 I worked for Gifs.com in San Francisco as a software engineer.

I was responsible for full-stack development and devops for a browser-based image/video editor, including implementation of server-side video processing. Built using Go, React/Redux, Google Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes.
