From 2007 to 2009 I had the privilege of being a performer and Musical Director for the Stars and Garters Theatre Company in San Francisco. Our shows included several runs of _The Curse of the Goddamned Ship_—which toured the Pacific Northwest—semi-regular _Show and Tell_ variety shows, and our largest production, _The Robber Bridegroom_, for which I composed and directed a live musical score.
