I had the honor of composing and directing a full score—written for bass, piano, harp, and oboe—for this beautiful film by Carrie Cronenwett. From the website:

>An experimental historical narrative set in a mythologized, post-revolutionary Russia that re-imagines the 1921 uprising of the Kronstadt sailors with a twist of gender anarchy. Agit-prop theatre group the Blue Blouses guides us through the story which is narrated through fictional letters written by Stepan Petrichenko, leader of the provisional Revolutionary Committee.
