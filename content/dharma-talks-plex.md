This plugin for [Plex Media Server](https://plex.tv/) provides a channel based on [Thomas Buckley-Houston](http://tombh.co.uk/)'s excellent [Dharma API](http://dharma-api.com/), which scrapes various dharma talk websites and provides an API to access their metadata.

The Dharma Talks channel can be installed through the official Plex plugin directory, accessed through the Plex client on any device.
