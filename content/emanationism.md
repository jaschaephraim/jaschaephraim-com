>**Emanationism** is an idea in the cosmology or cosmogony of certain religious or philosophical systems. … Emanationism is a transcendent principle from which everything is derived, and is opposed to both Creationism (wherein the universe is created by a sentient God who is separate from creation) and materialism (which posits no underlying subjective and/or ontological nature behind phenomena being immanent). ―[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanationism), 3/9/2014

Using examples from Indian, Judaic, Islamic, and Greek philosophy, and from Max Weber’s initial application in the fields of sociology and economics, I identify seven essential characteristics of emanationism.
