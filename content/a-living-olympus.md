In 2008 I wrote, scored, directed, and produced a film called _A Living Olympus_. It follows a large ensemble of musicians as we traveled around San Francisco, and recorded live performances in an elaborate set built in [Chicken John Rinaldi](http://chickenjohn.com/)'s Mission warehouse.

Fiscal sponsorship was secured through the Fleishhacker Foundation, and production was completed within a weekend. I am still in the process of completing the post-production myself as time allows.
