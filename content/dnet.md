The Java application DNet—based on algorithms described in Russell and Norvig's _Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach_—is capable of representing any well-formed Bayesian [decision network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_network) consisting of discrete decision nodes, discrete variable nodes, and a single utility node.

Probabilistic inference can be performed exactly by enumeration or approximately by Gibbs sampling.
